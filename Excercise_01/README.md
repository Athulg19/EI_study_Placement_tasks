# Exercise 1: Design Patterns Demonstration ðŸ§©

This part of the repository is dedicated to demonstrating the implementation of various software design patterns in Java. Each subdirectory within this folder contains examples of specific types of design patterns - Behavioral, Creational, and Structural.

## Directory Structure ðŸ“‚

- **Behavioral Design Patterns**: This folder includes examples of design patterns that manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects. Typically, these patterns focus on how objects interact and distribute responsibility.
- **Creational Design Patterns**: Here, you'll find examples of design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
- **Structural Design Patterns**: This section contains implementations of patterns concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

## Patterns Covered ðŸ“˜

### Behavioral
- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.

### Creational
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Structural
- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## How to Use ðŸš€

Each pattern directory contains a separate `README.md` that explains the pattern, its importance, and an example code. Navigate into each folder to learn more about the pattern and see the Java code implementation.

Feel free to explore the examples provided in each folder to better understand how these design patterns can be implemented and utilized in real-world Java applications.
